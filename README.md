###1. Project description

This my Bachelor Thesis project for the University of Zaragoza. The goal was to build a SCADA that would:
  1. Provide control operations over any brand of PLC
  2. Remote access to the control platform

These requirements were met by developing a **Python web application**, with **Django** and **Bootstrap** as frameworks, that is allocated in a **Apache** server with **WSGI** technology and that is capable of meeting **SCADA** standards through **OPC** communicaiton.
